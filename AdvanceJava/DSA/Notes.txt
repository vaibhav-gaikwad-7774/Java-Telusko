Notes of DataStructure which is help to recall the function:

16.5:

primitive data type:
how to save the data and save the memory and managing the data with more dynamicn ways

algo is set of instruction
the Raw action whichh is easily understand the user to what to do is the pseudo code
like the bello :

input a
input b
sum a+b
output sum

its imp to make fast process to do the certain operation in the bellow 

the speed of Any application will be increased by the DataStructure

We have types of DataStructure
list
linkedlist
array 
set
tree 
graph

16.12:
ADT(Abstract data type)

data is used for the 
data collection
data processing
data output
data storage

Concept and Datatype which is used to define the DataStructure
which is called thw abstract data type 


16:19
Arrays:qaa



With the help of the ADT we can do the Different
operation which is really usefull for the data managing 
on array

like finding the number of address:
searchig of elements:
inserting num
deleting 
 

 time taken for any operation which having to do the 
 array:
 Time complaxity will define the code effieciency

Time complaxity:

algo analysis:
space and time complaxity play imp role in the code

searchig elements in a sorted array having the 
two mainly method which is :

linear search and
binary search


Linear Search:

5 7 9 12 17 

target us 12 then we can compare the Each elements
 
when we finding the 1 elememts is easy but havingthe 4th element is
is little bit tricky we have to check the Each Elemenmt with the starting and upto the Ending 


Linear Search pseudo algorithm which is like the follow:

linear Search (A: list of Items, Target: the Item which we are searching)

firstly find the lengh of the A and Store it in a variable
like these n = lenght of a

then with using the if condition we can search the element untill
find target of Elemenmt like these
if A[i] equals target then
return i //return the Index for the Elemement which is found
and if
element is not found then end the procedure
end statement and print the Element is not Found:

like these 
end for return -1 //if the targeted Element is not found in the Arrays
end procedure

binary Search:
